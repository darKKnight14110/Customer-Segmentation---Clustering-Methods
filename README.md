This project employed the RFM model to segment our customer base into distinct groups based on their Recency (time since last purchase), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary Value (total spent). We use techniques of Unsupervised Learning - KMeans Clustering to segment the customers.We worked on dataset with 5lac rows sampled to 1 lac. By analysing these segments, we gained valuable insights into customer behaviour. The results reveal a high value segment with low recency, a mid value segment and a low value segment with high recency. This segmentation allows us to personalise marketing strategies for each group, such as offering exclusive discounts and loyalty programs to our high-value segment to incentivize continued engagement, and implementing win-back campaigns with special offers for the low-frequency segment to re-activate them By implementing these targeted strategies, we can improve customer engagement, retention, and ultimately, drive revenue growth.By implementing these targeted strategies, we can improve customer engagement, retention, and ultimately, drive revenue growth
