In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records 
from a groceries firm's database. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers 
into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I will divide customers into 
segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products 
according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater 
to the concerns of different types of customers. Through the analysis , we understand which 
clustering method is the best for the current dataset and can be used for future classification on 
test-data .We choose the scoring metric as “Silhouette Score” and “Davies-Bouldin Index”

The clustering models used are:
1. KMeans Clustering
2. DBSCAN
3. Agglomerative Clustering
4. Mean Shift Clustering
